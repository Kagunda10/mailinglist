This is a simple python script that fetches pastebins paste and searches for emails in the paste. It then checks for valid emails
and then persists them to MongoDb database

#Why?

Fun, and i also needed a way to market my online store and other websites without having to spend a lot

#Getting started 

This obvious shabang!

>pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the script 

>python main.py
